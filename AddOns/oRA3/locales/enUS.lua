|cff44ff44/radur|r - Opens the durability list.
|cff44ff44/razone|r - Opens the zone list.
|cff44ff44/rares|r - Opens the resistance list.
|cff44ff44/radisband|r - Instantly disbands the raid with no verification.
|cff44ff44/raready|r - Performs a ready check.
|cff44ff44/rainv|r - Invites the whole guild to your group.
|cff44ff44/razinv|r - Invites guild members in the same zone as you.
|cff44ff44/rarinv <rank name>|r - Invites guild members of the given rank.
