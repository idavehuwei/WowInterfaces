Technical Changes (Things other mod authors need to know):
* Major core re-write to allow XBar to natively support more than just spells.  XCustomBar will create new bars with less overhead than before, causing slightly less interface lag.  Due to major changes, XBar will now start again at version 3.00, and user settings must be re-created (bars re-positioned, etc...).
* Several options for addons have been standardized, allowing users to more easily create addons for XBar, while not sacrificing the flexibility of the bars.  Authors of existing addons to XBar will have to re-write their mods to make it use the new system, but the mods will require significantly less code than before.
* Switched to a more secure binding system for the default show/hiding of the bars
* Made code optimizations to reduce interface lag by throttling event handlers.  Calls to the BAG_UPDATE event are now handled directly by the XBarLoader object, and should be registered through the function provided, unless specific bag-slot related info is handled.
