Tag as 3.0.3


--------------------

Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Added LSM callbacks for _Registered to be abel to use textures that are loaded after Quartz.
	- Fix configuration of buff text color.
	- Add dry-coded ConfigMode support.
	Just simple ON/OFF handling, API taken from http://www.wowwiki.com/ConfigMode
	- Added a global unlock mechanic to Player/Target/Focus/Pet bars.
	- Moved cast time precision to a better place and fetch new locale.
	- Added a global option to change the precision of the cast time on cast bars.
	- Fix the tiling of the statusbars introduced by patch 3.3.3.
	- Check if the returns of Unit(Casting|Channel)Info are valid.
	- Properly disable the targetname option again.
	- Move the "Target Name" option into the Player module.
	The Target of a cast is only detectable for the player
	at this point, and thus we only show the option for him.
