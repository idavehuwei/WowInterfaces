Version 4.0.6 (by Thandrenn)

- Fixed quest 2 for LBRS & UBRS in DE localization file. Quest 2 was conflicting with Quest 4.
- Added a missing '-' in DE localization file. Problem occurred when playing on Public Test Realm 2.2 patch.
- Moved item names for LBRS, UBRS and DM quests into EN and DE localization files so they can be translated.  (Reported by maqjav)
- Updated Arcatraz numbers for Atlas 1.10.0
- Added 3 quests for Black Temple (missing some info though)
- Various fixes to quests thanks to Celellach and SaiBork.
- Quests added:
	- Deadmines: The Unsent Letter (drops off VanCleef)  (from Celellach)
	- Black Temple: Seek Out the Ashtongue
	- Black Temple: Redemption of the Ashtongue
	- Black Temple: The Fall of the Betrayer
	- SM Lib & Armory: In the Name of the Light  (from Celellach)

	- Deadmines completed.
	- Wailing Caverns completed.
	- Ragefire Chasm completed.
	- Uldaman completed.
- In cases where the Horde and Alliance have the same quest info, I'm now having the Horde version refer (via code) to the Alliance version. I think it was Lothaer that started doing this with the BC quests. Seems like a good idea and it'll save time for any translators down the road.
- Using two decimals in version number now, like Atlas and AtlasLoot use.
