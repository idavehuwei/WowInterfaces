4.2.26 - Change: More CPU load changes.  This should be a pretty big improvement. Let me know on WoWInterface or Curse.  Feedback is important!  :)

4.2.25 - Bugfix:  Fixed the problem of errors on game load.
It looks as if it was erroring when it was trying to pre-load spells that didn't exist to the player (the character was too low in level and didn't have the spell or didn't have it trained.)
Thanks for all the bug reports on this one, hopefully this gets it fixed for good.  :)

4.2.24 - Change:  Added some code to help with CPU load.  Should drop CPU load a bit while the addon isn't showing alerts.
Bugfix:  Fixed a problem with timers not showing on alerts that had procced after an alternate alert had shown.
Bugfix:  Hopefully fixed the problem of errors on initial load of the game.
         (Note that I wasn't able to replicate this problem, and not everyone is having the issue.  If you are one of the people having this problem, please report it! Thanks!)

  Bugfix:  Fixed bug where frames wouldn't close when using the ESC key.

Note:  Because of the way Blizzard IDs and names their procs to spells, and to allow this mod to be easily localized, I have to sort by spell IDs in the options menu.  As such, not all spells that have multiple ranks will be in alphabetical order.
