**OneBank3** is the latest in a long line of bank bag replacements for the default bank bags that will combine all of your bags into one frame.

OneBag has a long history of minimalism and OneBank3 will continue to uphold the standard of easy of use and simplicity it's predecessors set.  Like the earlier versions OneBank will continue to offer powerful options for those who wish to delve a little deeper.  

Also in the vein of earlier iterations I've kept to the philosophy of doing as little work as possible, as a result the code base is very small, and most of it is in the OneCore library.  As of the time of writing there are only 227 lines of code unique to OneBank3, and only 981 lines of code in OneCore itself.  LoC is a horrible stat in general, but it's fun none the less, and I cheat horribly since I build off the powerful [[http://www.wowace.com/projects/Ace3|Ace3 libraries]].

===Features                  
* **Can now run completely independent of OneBag3**
* Combines all of your bank bags into one.

* Inherent support for addons that interact with the default bags.

===Future Plans
* Release OneView3, and OneVault3

===The Family
; OneCore
: The brains and the brawn of the outfit, Core does all the heavy lifting both logic and layout wise.  This is embedded in OneBag by default, and you shouldn't need to worry about installing it unless you're running no-lib builds.

; OneBag3 
: OneBank's adventurous brother who didn't mind being dragged through a dank swamp, Bag does pretty much the exact same job for your character's bag as OneBank3 does for your bank bags.

===Bug Reports & Suggestions
Please report all bug reports to [[http://www.wowace.com/projects/OneBank3/tickets|my tracker on WowAce]].

I want to thank all the users who've been using OneBag and OneBank for so long.  I'm hoping not to leave the code on autopilot quite like I did once OB2 went stable, although it was nice to not have to touch it for almost two years.
