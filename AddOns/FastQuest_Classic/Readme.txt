 Summary
=========
FastQuest Classic is an addon to enhance quest log displaying, quest 
tracking, and notification. This is an alternative to heavy duty add-ons 
like MonkeyQuest, Quest-I-On, etc. The difference is that the code is 
much smaller and faster, since it uses Blizzard's build-in components 
enhancing and improving them. But it does not have full set of features 
those addons offer, so try them and decide what is best for you! 

==============================
 History of FastQuest Classic
==============================
FastQuest Classic is originally called "FastQuest" and is written by Vashen. 
Vashen had left WoW after he released the great FastQuest 2.11. Since then, 
FastQuest has some minor udpated by some fans including the WoWBox* Alfred. 
While I am trying to contact Vashen and also Alfred to seek for some other 
minor update for FastQuest, I did not get any response from them at that 
time. Then I decide to picked it up and try to fixed some minor issues, I 
then register an continued addon on Curse. Since that, FastQuest is released 
with version number like 2.11.1, 2.11.2, 2.11.3, etc.

When the TBC was going to be released in US and Europe, Vashen was back and 
he decided to continue the implementation. Vashen started the new FastQuest 
with version number 3.x and was supported with Titan and Fubar. I saw Vashen's 
messages and actions, I was thinking it's about the time to turn back this 
great addon to Vashen and also the credits.

However, there are some players still love the classic and standalone 
FastQuest, including me. So I decide to rename the addon name to 
"FastQuest Classic" and started from version 2.11.207.

 Features
==========
    * Enhances Blizzard's Quest WatchFrame! Automatically add current quests 
	  to WatchFrame and removes them when they are completed. This option 
	  is ON by default and can be toggled by /fq autoadd.
    * Easy quest tracking. You can use RightClick or Shift+click quest names 
	  in QuestLog window to Add/Remove quests manually. (/fq clear will 
	  remove all quest from the tracker)
    * Adds formatting options for Shift+LeftClick / Crtl+LeftClick / 
	  Ctrl+RightClick into chat use /fq format to cycle through them. Allows 
	  "[10+] QuestName", "[10] QuestName (Elite)", etc.
    * Use Ctrl+RightClick on the quest to send not only quest title but also 
	  quest objective to chat frame, it makes things easier when you are going 
	  to tell people what quest you are investigating without typing quest 
	  detail by your self.
    * Quests in WatchFrame are displayed in color that is based on difficulty. 
	  There are now over 20 shades of colors from bright green to bright red 
	  that are used to denote quest and monster difficulty. Quest that would 
	  be come trivial next level is highlighted giving you chance to complete 
	  it while it still yields exp.
    * Automatically notify your party/guild/raid/near-by people of your quest 
	  progress (example: Thistle Boar Slain 5/7), this option is off by 
	  default and can be toggled by /fq autonotify
    * Notify your party/guild/raid or near-by people for your level-up or new 
	  area/zone discovered is configurable. Sometimes you may want to enable 
	  this feature so that your partners may now your recent status when you 
	  all are looking for some place together or s/he is farming together with 
	  you for your leveling-up.
    * Allows you to insert quest objectives of the selected quest into the 
	  chat. Open the chatbox and right click on the quest name. (check the 
	  screenshot above.) Control click on the quest name also lists objectives 
	  but in the shorter form, the way they are displayed in quest tracker.
    * Allows WatchFrame to be draged anywhere on the screen (use "/fq unlock" 
	  to enable draging and you can "/fq lock" to lock it in place).
    * Automatically complete turn-in quests such as the once in AV that you 
	  have to turn in one by one. When you right click on the NPC to turn in 
	  quest, FQ will click "Continue" and "Complete Quest" buttons for you, 
	  but will stop to let you pick reward if choice is given. The down side 
	  is that you will not be able to read what NPC's replies to you when you 
	  turn in your quest, but that's only to those who actually read it :) 
	  This feature is off by default and can be toggled by /fq autocomplete
    * Configurable options are now supported with slash command "/fq options", 
	  or simply click on the minimap icon or Quest Log's "FQ" button.
