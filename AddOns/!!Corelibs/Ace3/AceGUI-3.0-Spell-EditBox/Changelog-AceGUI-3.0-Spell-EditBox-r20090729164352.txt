Shadowed:
	* Added Ace3 as an optional dependency so it won't error depending on load order
	* I spell gud
	* Added the ability to use the arrow keys to browse through the predicted spell list
	* Upped the prediction list to 10 rows (was 8)
	* Upped the delay to 500 spells per 0.10 second but made the time elapsed run every 0.10 seconds without time loss, and update the prediction frame every 1 second while scanning
	* Initial Import: Let's see if this works
