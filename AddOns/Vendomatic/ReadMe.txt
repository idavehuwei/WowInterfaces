1. What will this addon do for you?
This addon has 3 major functions:
	- Auto sell grey items
	- Auto repair your character
	- Auto restock 

Auto sell your grey items:
This addon will automaticly sell all your grey items in your bags for you. All you have to do is open a merchant window. You don't have to wait for the addon to finish up. 
If there's a grey item that you dont want to sell you can put it on the exceptions list we created for you. That way the addon will not sell that item. Of course this entire function can be turned off from the main options menu.

Auto repair your character:
Every time you open a window with an NPC that has the ability to repair, the addon will repair automaticly for you. The default variable is set for it to repair regardless of the cost. If you want to be prompted on every repair, or want to set a treshold above which the addon needs to prompt you for repairs, you can do this from the options menu. Of course the entire function can be turned off as well

Auto restock your items:
Probably one of the most cool functions of this addon. It will keep your stocks of ammo/food/water/reagents/whatever up. You can specify an amount you want to have in your bags all the time. Whenever you visit a vendor that sells the item, this addon will check the amount you already have, and buy the amount you need. Because some things come in large stacks (arrows, bullets) by default this addon will overstack a little. If you don't want this, and you'd rather be understacked than overstacked, you can turn if off in the options menu. Of course this enitre option can be turned off as well.


2. What will this addon NOT do for you:
This addon will NOT:
Waste CPU cycles. We coded this addon to be lightweight and use as less of cpu cycles and memory as possible. We know you dont want to have long loading times or lag because of addons. The auto selling of grey items for example, will only search your bags if you looted a grey item from the last time you sold everything.
This addon will NOT:
Automaticly sell white, green, blue or epic items you dont use. We cannot know who will use what so you'll have to sell those yourself.


3. Slash commands:
The following slash commands are availible for the Vend-o-matic addon:
