OmniCC is an addon that adds text to items/spells/abilities that are on cooldown to indicate when they'll be ready for use. OmniCC should be compatible with any addon that uses a cooldown model.

A configuration interface is included, and can be shown via /omnicc or /occ

Changes since OmniCC 2:
* Added blacklisting support
* Merged Pulse and Shine into the core addon.
* Redesigned the options menu
* Moved development over to GitHub

Whitelisting frames:

I've nixed this in the latest beta.  However, OmniCC now obeys the CooldownModel.noCooldownCount flag once again.

Blacklisting frames:

OmniCC 3 comes with another new option "Only display text on frames not on the blacklist" When enabled, OmniCC looks for frames that have names that match items on the blacklist. If a frame matches, then OmniCC will not display text on a frame. For example, adding "ActionButton" to the blacklist will cause both ActionButton1 and ActionButton2 to not show cooldown text.

GitHub:

OmniCC development has moved from GogleCode to GitHub. The intention is to make it easier for people to fork/contribute to OmniCC development (and also for me to learn about git). Writing code for me typically gets your request implemented faster than asking me to write it myself :P

Submitting bugs & feature requests:

In order of preference, here's where you should submit bug reports and feature requests:
* GitHub
* GoogleCode
* Wherever you downloaded the addon

I read/have RSS feeds for everywhere, so don't think too much about it
