TipTacTalents Changes | 2009 Mar 19
-----------------------------------

TipTacTalents Changes | 2009 Mar 17

TipTacTalents Changes | 2009 Mar 13
-----------------------------------
- Occasionally the TipTac fadeout could get halted because of an update from TipTacTalents, I've fixed this by not allowing TipTacTalents to call "GTT:Show()" to resize the tip during fadeout.

TipTacTalents Changes | 2009 Mar 12
-----------------------------------
- After some more testing with adjusting the trottle time, it seems that compeltely removing it, that is setting it to zero, actually seems like the best solution, at least this is where I found the least mixed talents. Please let me know if you're still seeing wrong specs in the tips.
- Made some minor code changes.

TipTacTalents Changes | 2008 Nov 05
-----------------------------------
- Increased the throttle time for talent queries from 0.25 to 0.75 sec, hopefully that fixes some more of the problems with wrong talents listed on tips. But they will still occur with rapid mouse moving.

-----------------------------------
- TipTacTalents will no longer request talents when the default inspect window is open, just like it already does when the Examiner addon is open.

-----------------------------------
- Changed the TOC version to 30000 for the Wrath of the Lich King patch.
- When Examiner is installed, and opened, TipTacTalents will not request talent info, as this would cause problems in Examiner's talent tab.
- If the player has no talents, it will no longer state the name of the first talent tab and (0/0/0), but instead: "No Talents".
- Changed the default cache size up to 25.

TipTacTalents Changes | 2008 Apr 06
-----------------------------------
- Added some different formatting styles for the Talent line in the tip, you have to edit the Lua file to change it though, by uncommenting some lines. Look at line 17 and after.
- Removed the obsolete 2.3.3 inspect checking.
- Fixed a nil error that could happen under special circumstances.
- TipTacTalents should no longer block you from getting the talents of same faction players who are marked for PvP.
