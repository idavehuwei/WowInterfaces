TipTacTalents Changes | 2009 Mar 13
-----------------------------------
- Occasionally the TipTac fadeout could get halted because of an update from TipTacTalents, I've fixed this by not allowing TipTacTalents to call "GTT:Show()" to resize the tip during fadeout.

TipTacTalents Changes | 2009 Mar 12
-----------------------------------
- After some more testing with adjusting the trottle time, it seems that compeltely removing it, that is setting it to zero, actually seems like the best solution, at least this is where I found the least mixed talents. Please let me know if you're still seeing wrong specs in the tips.
- Made some minor code changes.

TipTacTalents Changes | 2008 Nov 05
-----------------------------------
- Increased the throttle time for talent queries from 0.25 to 0.75 sec, hopefully that fixes some more of the problems with wrong talents listed on tips. But they will still occur with rapid mouse moving.

- TipTacTalents should no longer block you from getting the talents of same faction players who are marked for PvP.
